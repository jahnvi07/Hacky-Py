#                                 Welcome to DataFlair Hangman Game:
# The objective of the project is to implement the hangman game using Python. 
# It doesnâ€™t require any specific modules other than random and time. 
# Python loops and functions are enough to build this game here.
# The functions that we use here contain arguments that are defined in a global scope which can be further used in other functions to improve game quality.
# It can also be used to provide different steps when required to execute upon conditions by the for and while loops.

# Initial Steps to invite in the game:
print("\nWelcome to Hangman game by DataFlair\n")

print("The game is about to start!\n Let's play Hangman!")
